#### CONFIGURATION

Create a MySQL or MariaDB database.

Run the command ``bash init.sh`` from the root directory and set the correct informations as asked.\
Your database will be updated with all the values required to start the game (basic characters, enemies, weapons, events, etc.).

You can now start the server with ``php run.php``: the php server will run on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).\
If you wish, you can leave the server running in the background with ``php run.php -b``. Run ``php stop.php`` to stop it.

Run the command ```bash start.sh```. That's it. You're good to go!

### NOTES

This game was a school project completed in 2 weeks, so... serious problems remain. But it was a good way to learn some programming concepts.
