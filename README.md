#### CONFIGURATION
Create a MySQL or MariaDB database.

Run the command `bash init.sh` from the root directory and provide the required information as prompted:
- The name of the server host (localhost by default).
- The port for this server (3306 by default).
- Your SQL user.
- The SQL password.
- The name of the created database.

Your database will be updated with all the values required to start the game (basic characters, enemies, weapons, events, etc.).

You can now run the command `bash start.sh`. Your browser will open a window with the game started. That's all!

To properly stop the game, run `bash stop.sh`.

### NOTES

This game was a school project completed in 2 weeks, so... serious problems remain. But it was a good way to learn some programming concepts.
